		<h1>Nonogram</h1>
		<p><strong>Nonograms</strong>, also known as <strong>Picross</strong> or <strong>Griddlers</strong>, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one white square between successive sets. <cite>Wikipedia</cite></p>
